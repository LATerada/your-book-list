# Your Book List

## Junior React Developer Test

In this project, I developed a website where you can create a book list by adding and removing books from the list.
To add a book, simply fill in the required fields, and if you'd like, you can also include the URL of an image!


## 📱 Project Funcionalities
* Render a book list
* Add a book to the list
* Delete a book from the list
* See the detail of each book

<img src="./public/homePage.png" width="600"  />
<img src="./public/addNewBook.png" width="600"  />
<img src="./public/bookAdded.png" width="600"  />
</div>
